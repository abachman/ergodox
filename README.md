### Infinity ErgoDox Layouts

Built using [the input club configurator](http://configurator.inputclub.com/alpha/?layout=MDErgo1-Default).

The goal is a programmer friendly layout that doesn't break my brain. I've been using 006 and up for several years now. 7, 8, and 9 are just touchups.

### My Current Layout

### CHANGELOG

#### **009**
- change to https://configurator.input.club/alpha/?layout=MDErgo1-Blank, original configurator has stopped working
- layer 3 changes for Fortnite
  - swap LGUI for LALT to avoid accidental command-w quitting games
  - put F4 on secondary left hand escape for building convenience
  - swap . and , for PGUP and PGDN on left thumb since Fortnite stopped recognizing PGUP and PGDN
